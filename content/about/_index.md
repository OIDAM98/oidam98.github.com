Nice to meet you! :wave:

My name is Oscar. I have been programming since the beginning of my college life and I feel very enthusiastic about learning new topics, both related and non-related to technology.

My programming career has been very wide; ranging from **Backend developer**, using *JS* with *Node* and *AWS Lambdas*, in a telemedicine startup, to currently a **BI Engineer**, using *Looker* with some backend tasks with *Java Spring*, as a contractor.

Currently I am very excited about using *Scala* and learning more about *Functional Programming*, along with its use cases in common software problems.

Also, I'm interested in learning about *Cloud Computing* and how it has changed the way we think about the problems and the modeling for proposed solutions.
