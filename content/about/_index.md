This is my about page. :wave:

Have been programming since the beginning of my college life, and I am very enthusiastic about learning new topics, both related and non-related to technology.

Currently I am very excited about using *Scala* and learning more about *Functional Programming*, along with its use cases in common software problems. Also, I'm interested in learning about *Cloud Computing* and how it has changed the way we think about the problems and the modeling for proposed solutions.
