The Scala programming language was used for the implementation of the mentioned techniques. Also, the Scala Parser Combinators library was used for creating a parser and a language that allowed to successfully read both the test collection and the user&amp;rsquo;s query.
For the parser&amp;rsquo;s query, the AND, OR and NOT boolean operations were implemented, along with their precedence, and the usage of parenthesis to group together operations.</description></item><item><title>Classroom Reservation System</title><link>/portfolio/classroom/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 16:03:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>/portfolio/classroom/</guid><description>A classroom reservation that allows users to show the classrooms that are reserved, their schedule and by whom it was reserved. It also shows the active periods of the current semester and the subjects that are active for the semester.
Scala was used to implement the system, along with its Swing library to develop a desktop interface. The application conects to a local database in PostgreSQL, using Doobie for handling the connection.</description></item></channel></rss>
