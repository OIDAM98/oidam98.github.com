      <description>A simple React Native application which let&amp;rsquo;s the user browse Reddit and save desired posts to a relational database hosted in Heroku. It was developed using the TypeScript byndings for React Native 0.61.5 along with the data models of the application and the REST requests to Reddit and the database server.
The database server was developed using JavaScript ES6 with Node.Js/Express in order to expose a simple REST API that the application connects to in order for the data to be saved.</description>

      <description>A search engine that was based upon the Inverted Index technique along with the Boolean Retrieval Model for querying the Cranfield Test Collection.
The Scala programming language was used for the implementation of the mentioned techniques. Also, the Scala Parser Combinators library was used for creating a parser and a language that allowed to successfully read both the test collection and the user&amp;rsquo;s query.
For the parser&amp;rsquo;s query, the AND, OR and NOT boolean operations were implemented, along with their precedence, and the usage of parenthesis to group together operations.</description>
