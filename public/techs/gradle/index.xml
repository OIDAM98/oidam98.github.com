      <description>A Tetris Clone developed in Java using Swing for the User Interface.
A leveling system was implented where pieces will fall of faster depending on the level, increasing the difficulty. Also, a scoring system was implemented along with most of the sound effects of the game.
Gradle was primarily used for creating a JAR of the application that contained all the images and sound effects used.
It was developed as the final project for Graphics and Animation course (Lis3021).</description>
